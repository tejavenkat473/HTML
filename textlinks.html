<p>Even though Israel is a small country it is always in the news.
The news continues to report on Jews moving to Israel,on the technology invented there, but also on conflict, wars and tensions with surrounding people.</p>  
Why? A look at Israelâ€™s history in the book of Genesis in the Bible reveals that 4000 years ago a man, who is now very well known, went on a camping trip in that part of the world.  
The Bible says that his story affects our future.
